Note:
1.All raw data are divided into test and training sets according to the proportion of 20% and 80%.In the test and training sets, the data set is divided into "control" group and "treatment" group.  
2.In these data sets, some of the data sets are real data, and some of them are only features.So we need to generate the data according to the DGP process in "Transfer Learning for Estimating Causal Effects using Neural Networks". In the src/  folderï¼ŒFiles ending with "_data" are used in the DGP process. Each data set has a corresponding "XX_data.py". Because some data sets are real data, these data sets may not use the corresponding "XX_data.py" To generate data, but I still prepared him.  
3.As you can see, the files starting with "X-learner" or "Y-learner" are implementations of XY-learner    
4.random_forest.PY is the code for Regression Tree and Random Forest  
5.The code of RF_X.py is a reproduction of X-learner with RandomForest as a model  
6.Linerregression.py is the code for Linear Regression, and BART.py is the code for testing Bayesian Additive Regression Tree
